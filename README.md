SeisFlows
=========

SeisFlows is an open source seismic inversion package that

- Delivers a complete, customizable waveform inversion workflow

- Provides a framework for research in regional, global, and exploration seismology

Examples and usage guidelines are available online at [readthedocs.org](http://seisflows.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

SeisFlows has an idiosyncratic workflow-based design informed by familiarity with different research problems (oil and gas exploration, earthqake tomography, medical imaging) and experience working in different computing environments (including various high-performance computing clusters).

With SeisFlows, wave simulations must be performed using an external software package such as SPECFEM2D or SPECFEM3D.  The ability to interface with external solvers ensures flexibility, and the choice of SPECFEM as a default option gives access to cutting-edge meshing and hardware accelaration capabilities.  However, the use of external package also creates additional work for the user, because to carry out an inversion, one must become familiar not only with SeisFlows, but also with a separate solver package.
